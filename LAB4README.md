**Samhita Argula Lab 4 README**

1. Why are these dependencies required if we already have the javaee-api in our pom.xml?
Javaee API may already have the interfaces we need to compile, but we need to add dependencies to use them at runtime or for testing.

2. Document the following:
1. Paragraph that describes the business domain you have chosen to work with, and
why.
2. Write a second paragraph answering the following questions: There is only one
entity required for Lab 4, but what other entities from your business domain can
you think of? How might they relate to one another? You can answer this in
narrative form, or you can answer it with a database diagram. One of your
midterm questions will be very similar, about the design of your FP, so this is to
help get you started early.
