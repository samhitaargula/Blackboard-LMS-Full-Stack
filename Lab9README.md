**Samhita Argula Lab 9 README**

**Changes from last lab**

In last lab, I didn't do cross groups for Students and Teachers, as I felt it wouldn't make sense.
But in this lab, I had an idea to do a cross role betweent these 2 entities where a student can also be a teaching assistant, so they would have the role of teacher as well.

As we are wrapping it all up towards the final project, I am understanding more about all the players in my domain and thus keep tweaking them.
